# Heart-disease-prediction
 
## This repository looks into using **data science libraries** in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of `predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.`

Steps to be followed:             
- 1.Problem definition                 
- 2.Data                   
- 3.Evaluation                   
- 4.Features                   
- 5.Modelling               
- 6.Experimentation
